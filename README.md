# My-stopwatch

This repo contains a stopwatch application that I made as part of the application for TPXimpact.

The stopwatch is accurate and has the following features:

- [x] Time display: The current elapsed time in the following format 00:00:00:00 (hours, minutes, seconds, centiseconds)
- [x] Start button: A button to start or continue a timer.
- [x]  Pause button: A button to pause the running timer.
- [x]  Reset button: A button to reset the timer to zero.
- [x] Lap button: A button to write the time to a list/table of laps (this would not pause the timer). The results should be shown on screen and still be visible if the page is refreshed.
- [x]  Clear lap history button: A button to clear any lap history
- [x]  Make it look good
- [x]  No bugs or quirky behaviour
